										<h1>My Story</h1>

                                    <p>My name is Sil Faber, I am a game programmer who recently graduated HBO CMGT at Saxion Enschede.<br><br>I have been playing video games as long as I can remember, and I consider it a great passion of mine. As I got older, I started thinking more about what it was exactly I liked so much about games. In doing this, I realized the sheer variety the gaming platform has to offer is unmatched. Games can be anything: a story as immersive and deep as a book, lifelike visuals that could come straight out of a movie, or they can have you at the edge of your seat in anticipation. Not only can games deliver on all these aspects in the same way as other creative media, but they can elevate the experience tenfold with interactivity.  The games that really inspired me were always those created by independent developers. It's these games like <i>Hotline Miami</i>, <i>The Binding of Isaac</i> and <i>Super Meat Boy</i> that were just not like anything we had seen before. The best games come from the most creative minds, and a developer that just really wants to put their work out there. The idea that I, that anyone could make something like this was a very exciting revelation to me. Any kind of idea can be realized however you want, as long as you have the time and creative juices to make it happen.<br> When the time came to choose what I wanted to study, it was kid of a no-brainer for me. I wanted to make games as well, and with the rich resources we have today, such as accessible game engines, practically infinite online resources, and even an entire study course to learn the ropes, nothing else seemed like a better fit to me than to become a game developer myself.</p>

										<h1>Skills and Experience</h1>
									</header>
                                    <p>As of writing this, I am a fourth-year student at CMGT, studying the Engineer course for game programming. I have learnt a lot in this time about many aspects of game development, and how they play into eachother. As a programmer, I have learnt most about the Unity engine. The Unity engine is the engine chosen by the course for most standalone and group projects, as well as being my engine of choice for the open choice classes. My classes have led me to explore many different aspects of the engine, from C# scripting to animations and shader graphs. In CMGT, every quartile within the first two years starts with a group project. This helps you put the new skills you gained to work in a team-based context. These projects taught me a lot about how to work in a team, and about how important it is for other members of the team to easily interact with your code. The project I learned the most from as a game developer was the solo game I made for my Minor: <a href="glowmentum.html">Glowmentum</a>. For this project, I took all the programming, game and art design upon myself. Through this experience, I have learned a lot about how to properly transfer an idea into gameplay mechanics and level design.<br>I also have limited experience with C++, but I plan on polishing this up sooner rather than later. I have an interest in Unreal Engine, and I would like to expand on this as well.</p>
