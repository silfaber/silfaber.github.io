								        <h3>About the game</h3>
								        <p>Bob is an overweight lad that is trying desperately to lose some weight, but he's having trouble keeping his desires in check. In this arcade game, 2 players duke it out in a 1v1, each playing as the angel or devil on Bob's shoulder. Will Bob resist, or give into his desires? <br>The two players verse eachother on opposite ends of the battlefield, and are tasked with sending projectiles and power-ups back and forth at each other, across 5 lanes.  </p>

                                        <p>Since this project took place halfway through the first year of my study, I was still quite inexperienced. For this project, we had to work in C# using the GXP Game Engine provided by our school. This engine was very bare-bones and didn't have any kind of user interface to work with, so all the graphics would have to be hardcoded. This wasn't all too bad, since the engine provided good tools for displaying sprites, but it was still quite a chore to animate and place sprites manually. Our game was quite sprite-heavy, and I was the only engineer working on the gamem, so implementing was quite a lot of work. The gameplay is quite simple at its core, so animating the sprites wasn't that big of an issue. Other than that, this was only the second project where we made a game in a team, so I still learned a lot about how to combine teamwork and creative thinking.</p>
