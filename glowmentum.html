								        <h3>About the game</h3>
								        <p>Glowmentum is a solo project I made for my Minor early in the 4th year of my studies. It's a first person parkour-platformer made in the Unity Engine. The game is all about going fast, using a grappling hook to swing and pull themselves around, the player will need to maintain and transform their momentum to get to the finish as fast as possible. Alternative routes through the levels that will challenge you to be very precise with your movement to get the best time. The game has a 3-star rating system, where the player can get up to 3 stars depending on how fast they completed the level. There are also a few more difficult locked levels that only unlock when you get enough 3-star rankings, made for the players that seek extra challenge. The game has so far been released on <a href="https://mudkipmonkey.itch.io/glowmentum">Itch.io</a>, and I plan to update it later as well.</p>

                                        <p>During this project, I learned a lot about many aspects of game development, from scripting, to level design, to testing to artistic design. I have always been a big fan of skill-based games where you go fast, since going fast can be a reward in itself. I wanted to make a gameplay-heavy experience that asked quite a bit from the player, and motivated them to be better with gameplay mechanics. I did this by making it satisfying to move around quickly using effects like speedlines on the edges of the screen that become more prevelant the faster the player is moving. <br>A lot of time was spent on making the gameplay feel as sharp as it can, since I wanted the game to feel snappy and easy to control. This process involved a lot of designing and programming, and in doing so I gained a better understanding of how to combine both effectively. The game expects a lot from the player, so the game should provide the player the means to control their character consistently and precisely. Besides this, the majority of my time was spent on designing levels and artistic design. Designing levels to best showcase the mechanics of the game was the biggest focus when designing levels, so I learned a lot about that as well. <br> At first I wasn't sure if visuals for the game would be within scope, but during the final phase of the project I wanted to tie the game together nicely with a simple, but effective, visual style. I figured a grid style would suit my game well, since all my level design is already grid based as well. It worked out quite well, and after further polishing the game up recently I can confidently say I am proud of how the game looks.</p>
