								        <h3>About the product</h3>
								        <p>For my graduation internship, I took on an internship with VR-Innovations, a young game development studio located in Zwolle. Here I was given a broad mission; to research and/or develop an AI tool to help accelerate the company's development cycle. After some extended preliminary research, we landed on the best option for the company being a GPT-powered Unity Assistant. At the time, GPT was by far the most powerful LLM (Large Language Model), which is considered the most well-developed branch of AI development. This led to research for which features would best suit the company. 
                                        <br><br> The final version of the GPT assistant includes the following features:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Full conversation between user and GPT</li>
                                            <li>Script/GameObject reading ability</li>
                                            <li>Script Editing, with a screen to preview all edits</li>
                                            <li>Script Generation</li>
                                            <li>Auto-saved chats</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <h3>What I learned</h3>
                                        <p>Given how this project was conducted for my graduation, I was able to learn a lot about different facets of game development. I was able to experience office culture entirely, with the company counsellor expecting more from me than was expected of me with the previous internship. Furthermore, I learned most about custom Unity editor window code and game development using AI. Given the company's broad request to accelerate their development pipeline using AI, I researched many different kinds of AI-powered products for usage within the company's development cycle. From AI generated skyboxes and 3D models to NPCs powered by an LLM (Large Language Model), we finally decided that the best fit for the company would be a GPT-Powered Unity Assistant. From here I researched how to utilize GPT's API, implement it for use in Unity, and create a custom Unity editor window to access it. Furthermore I also learnt about JSON encryption for saving conversations across sessions, as well as translating scripts and game objects into readable and editable text for GPT. Overall, I learnt most about how to effectively work along with GPT through my prompt engineering research, as I found out there is no one way to get GPT to create the perfect code right away. Rather, working with GPT is more about mutually understanding eachother's input and still being critical of applied changes.</p>
