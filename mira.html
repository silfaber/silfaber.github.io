								        <h3>About the game</h3>
								        <p>Mira is a group project I participated in during the last quartile of Year 2 of my study. In this team of 2 designers, 2 engineers and 4 artists I partook as one of the engineers. The game takes place in the ocean, with the main character Mira. Mira is a girl that loves the sea, it makes her feel connected to the nature and the animals that live within. Part of the project was to send an environmental message, and we went with teaching the player about pollution at sea. In the game, Mira explores the ocean and has several run-ins with beautiful fish and coral, but also sees the terrible pollution that it is affected by. In the game, Mira fights off the pollution by cleaning the ocean and preventing more trash from getting dropped into the ocean.</p>

                                        <h3>What I learned</h3>
                                        <p>In this project, I was working on the game with a second engineer. This was not something I was used to, since every project I partook in so far I was either the only engineer, or the second engineer worked on very seperate assets. This was also the first and only project to last the entire quartile (Â±2 months) as opposed to the normal 2-3 week long project. Leaving the gameplay mechanics to one engineer for this project wasn't quite feasible, since the scope of the project was so much larger, and our team was quite ambitious. This required me to adapt a lot more than I had to do with previous projects, since all my code would have to be readable for another engineer. Since the team was mostly made of designers and artists, the designers also did a lot of work in Unity. This was another lesson for me, since now I had to think about how to best adapt my code for usage in the Unity inspector. <br> For the game, I mainly worked on the player character's movement, camera control and UI. While mainly learning alot about scripting with a team, I also learned a lot about using Cinemachine (a Unity Extension) for camera control and cinematics.</p>
