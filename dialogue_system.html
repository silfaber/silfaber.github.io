								        <h3>About the game</h3>
								        <p>This project was one I did for my IMT&S (Immersive Media Technologies and Storytelling) project in the 4th year of eduction with CMGT at Saxion. For this project, I primarily worked for the client BeeYou Games, which was working with the social skill training company WijKracht to develop a serious game to replace the training's written homework. The children would learn a new aspect of social skills in their class, and then play the matching level to further reinforce the concepts taught in their most recent class. For this project, I was the gameplay programmer. The game is set up as a 2.5D sidescroller adventure game, with a focus on dialogue. The player needs to talk to the animals of the (magical) forest in order to progress through the level, while the level subtly quizzes them on the concepts tought in their most recent class.</p>

                                        <h3>What I learned</h3>
                                        <p> My primary role in this project was gameplay engineer, so I primarily focused on the game's basic systems, being the player controls and the dialogue system. Through this project, I've gained valuable insights in key areas. Firstly, I learned efficient pull request usage and version control with Git. Collaborating with my team, I mastered creating and reviewing pull requests, ensuring effective changes and project integration.

In Unity scripting, I improved practices and techniques, writing cleaner, optimized code for better performance and maintainability. Applying object-oriented principles and modular design enhanced script readability and scalability. These skills will elevate my future Unity projects.

Integration of external libraries like Cinemachine and Unity Ink was crucial. Research and experimentation empowered me to utilize Cinemachine for dynamic camera movements and Unity Ink for interactive storytelling and dialogue systems. These libraries expanded my toolkit for creating immersive experiences.

This project expanded my knowledge and skills significantly. Efficient pull request usage, improved Unity scripting, and integration of powerful libraries are key takeaways. These experiences will fuel my growth as a developer, enabling me to tackle future projects with confidence and efficiency.</p>
